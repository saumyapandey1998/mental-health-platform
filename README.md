Mental Health Management System

Building a mental health system

Project Overview

The Mental Health Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline mental health support by providing secure, digitalized tools for patients and therapists. This system aims to bridge the gap between individuals seeking mental health care and professionals offering support, ensuring confidentiality, ease of access, and user-centric features.

The platform empowers users by offering secure authentication, therapist matching, appointment scheduling, real-time communication, and mood tracking. Therapists can seamlessly manage patient records, view progress reports, and provide feedback, fostering an environment of collaborative mental health care.

Letâ€™s work together to create a better, more accessible mental health support platform!
